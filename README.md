# encryptor

A tool used to encrypt all files recursively **except** the code and the "enc.test" file.

While leaving the system unattended, ensure that you've encrypted the files using this
and decrypt it once you're back

The secret text inside the **enc.test** file is currently in plaintext, but once you've run the script, it'll encrypt that text also and thus noone without the password can decrypt any files.
